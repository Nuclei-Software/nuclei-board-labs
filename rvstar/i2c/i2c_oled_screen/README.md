# Introduction

This is an I2C example that uses RVSTAR board to control a 0.96-inch OLED screen(i2c interface) to show different characters and pictures.

# How to use

## Build and run using Nuclei SDK

Here are the steps build and run in Nuclei SDK using command line.

~~~shell
# clone nuclei-sdk repo and cd to it
git clone https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-sdk
cd nuclei-sdk
# Setup nuclei tools environment following https://doc.nucleisys.com/nuclei_sdk/quickstart.html#setup-tools-and-environment
# Assume you are in Windows, and have create and setup the setup_config.bat file
# source the nuclei tool environment
setup.bat
# clone nuclei-board-labs
git clone https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-board-labs
cd nuclei-board-labs/
# cd to this example
cd rvstar/i2c/i2c_oled_screen
# Build this example for nuclei rvstar board
## clean this example first
make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar clean
## build this example
make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar all
## connect rvstar board using USB dongle, and make sure driver is setup correctly
## see https://rvmcu.com/column-topic-id-464.html
## upload this example
make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar upload
## debug this example
make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103v_rvstar debug
~~~

Then you can see the OLED screen show Chinese characters, English characters and a lovely picutre.

## Build and run using other tools

If you are not familar with command line, you can also create projects using Nuclei Studio and PlatformIO IDE, put this example code in the IDE and then build, upload and debug on it.

### Create a project

You can create a project in Nuclei Studio IDE or PlatformIO IDE.

### Copy the source code

Copy all the *.c and *.h files from this directory and replace the existing application code in the IDE project directory.

### Build and Upload

Connect RVSTAR board with the OLED screen, and then connect RVSTAR to your PC, build and upload the project and then you can see the OLED screen show Chinese characters, English characters and a lovely picutre.
