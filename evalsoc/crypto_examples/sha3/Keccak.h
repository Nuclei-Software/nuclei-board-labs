/*!
@brief Function to compute the Keccak[r, c] sponge function over a given input.
@param  rate            The value of the rate r.
@param  capacity        The value of the capacity c.
@param  input           Pointer to the input message.
@param  inputByteLen    The number of input bytes provided in the input message.
@param  delimitedSuffix Bits that will be automatically appended to the end
                        of the input message, as in domain separation.
                        This is a byte containing from 0 to 7 bits
                        These <i>n</i> bits must be in the least significant bit positions
                        and must be delimited with a bit 1 at position <i>n</i>
                        (counting from 0=LSB to 7=MSB) and followed by bits 0
                        from position <i>n</i>+1 to position 7.
                        Some examples:
                            - If no bits are to be appended, then @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x01.
                            - If the 2-bit sequence 0,1 is to be appended (as for SHA3-*), @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x06.
                            - If the 4-bit sequence 1,1,1,1 is to be appended (as for SHAKE*), @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x1F.
                            - If the 7-bit sequence 1,1,0,1,0,0,0 is to be absorbed, @a delimitedSuffix must be 0x8B.
@param  output          Pointer to the buffer where to store the output.
@param  outputByteLen   The number of output bytes desired.
@pre    One must have r+c=1600 and the rate a multiple of 8 bits in this implementation.
