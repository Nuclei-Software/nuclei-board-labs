Get Started
===========

This section lists the needed development tools, Software source codes, and then describes how to get started with Nuclei board development.

Tools Requirement
#################
* `Nuclei Development Tools <https://www.nucleisys.com/download.php>`_

  * RISC-V GNU Toolchain: compiler, linker, assembler, debugger and so on 

  * Nuclei OpenOCD: support |nuclei_core|, used for development board

  * Windows build tools: a Windows specific package which provides GNU make, and BusyBox which provides a convenient implementation for sh/rm/echo.

* `Segger Embedded Studio <https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio/>`_  is a complete all-in-one solution for managing, building, testing, and deploying your embedded applications which support RISC-V processors, it provides a GUI based development environment.

* `Tera Term <http://ttssh2.osdn.jp/>`_ or `PuTTY <https://www.putty.org/>`_ for serial terminal connection. The serial configurations are 115200 baud, 8 bits data, 1 stop bit, and no parity (115200-8-N-1) by default.

Quick Start
###########

Develop with |nuclei_sdk|
***********************

|nuclei_sdk| includes Makefile, so you can develop your |nuclei_board| by using command line mode. There are scripts in it that you need to set up your development environment.

How to develop with |nuclei_sdk| step by step, please see this `online docs <http://doc.nucleisys.com/nuclei_sdk/quickstart.html>`__.

Develop with |ses|
******************

|ses| is a powerful C/C++ IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for embedded systems, you can work with it to develop your |nuclei_board| atfer environment setting manually. 

How to develop with |ses| step by step, please see this `online docs <http://www.riscv-mcu.com/quickstart-quickstart.html>`__.
