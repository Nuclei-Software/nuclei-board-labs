Introduction
============

This is a handbook for Nuclei Board Labs which is a part of courses in Nuclei University Program. 
This handbook describes how to develop with |nuclei_board| through a step-by-step way, can be used as lab teaching metarials. 
Anyone interested in |nuclei_core| can also take this handbook as a quick start-up to develop with |nuclei_core|.

The labs are developed based on the `Nuclei N/NX Embedded Software Development Kit (Nuclei SDK) <https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-sdk>`__ which is an open
software platform to facilitate the development of embedded systems based on
|nuclei_core|. For more details about |Nu-SDK|, please see its `online docs <https://nuclei-software.github.io/NMSIS/html/index.html>`__.

This handbook includes a series of labs (more labs will be added in the future), which are roughly classified into 2 levels:

* :ref:`Level 1: Basic Labs <level1_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the basic topics of |nuclei_board|. 
For example, the usage of on-board peripherals，the basic features of |nuclei_core|，and so on.

* :ref:`Level 2: Advanced Labs <level2_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the advanced topics of |nuclei_board|. 
For example, basic applications, Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), and so on.


Supported Hardware Platform
===========================

The following |nuclei_core| based hardware platforms (more boards will be added in the future) are supported in this handbook.

  * `RV-STAR Development Kit <http://www.riscv-mcu.com/quickstart-quickstart.html>`_
  * ...

You can click the above links to get the platform's data sheet and user manual as a reference.
